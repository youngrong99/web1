  <h2>CSS</h2>
  <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including
     colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to diffe
     rent types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. C
     SS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup languag
     e. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share
     style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This
     is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentati
     on.</p>
